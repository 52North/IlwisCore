/**
  Pool of http connection handlers. Connection handlers are created on demand and idle handlers are
  cleaned up in regular time intervals.
  <p>
  Example for the required configuration settings:
  <code><pre>
  minThreads=1
  maxThreads=100
  cleanupInterval=1000
  maxRequestSize=16000
  maxMultiPartSize=1000000
  </pre></code>
  The pool is empty initially and grows with the number of concurrent
  connections. A timer removes one idle connection handler at each
  interval, but it leaves some spare handlers in memory to improve
  performance.
  @see HttpConnectionHandler for description of config settings readTimeout
  @see HttpRequest for description of config settings maxRequestSize and maxMultiPartSize
