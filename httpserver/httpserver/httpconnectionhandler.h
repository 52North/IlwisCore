/**
  The connection handler accepts incoming connections and dispatches incoming requests to to a
  request mapper. Since HTTP clients can send multiple requests before waiting for the response,
  the incoming requests are queued and processed one after the other.
  <p>
  Example for the required configuration settings:
  <code><pre>
  readTimeout=60000
  maxRequestSize=16000
  maxMultiPartSize=1000000
  </pre></code>
  <p>
  The readTimeout value defines the maximum time to wait for a complete HTTP request.
  @see HttpRequest for description of config settings maxRequestSize and maxMultiPartSize
