 \brief creates ilwisobjects

 A general interface for factories for all kinds of ilwisobject. Note that is not needed that a factory can produce all types of objects.
 For example there exists a projectionfactory that only can produce projection objects. Factories are registered to the kernel and
 others can request a factory of a certain type from the kernel
