 * \brief The Time class  utility class that handles all time related things within Ilwis
 *
 * The time class is build upon the notion of the Julianday (astronomical) which starts its counting at 1 januari, noon, -4713 BC. <br>
 * In Ilwis the julian day is expressed as a double so fractional days are allowed. This enables the expression of hours, minutes and seconds. <br>
 * As far as Ilwis is considered the time object is just a number so normal mathematical operations apply to it. <br>
 * To the outside world the time class is often represented as an ISO 8601 compatible string and this is also one of the notation is expects as input.
