 The catalog class holds the collection of data in a certain data-source. Catalogs come in many shapes and sizes. Basically anything that can contain other
 Ilwis-objects is a catalog. The obvious example if of course a folder on the harddrive, but also file-formats that contain other objects can be considered catalogs, or services
 that give access to coverage, or ftp  network locations etc... Note that the class \ref Ilwis.CatalogView implements a filtered view on catalog(s).
